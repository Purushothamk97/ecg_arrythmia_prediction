# ECG_arrythmia_prediction
Predicting type of arrhythmia based on ecg data mpodified into csv files.
Dataset is obtained from kaggle with 5 classes of arrythmias.
The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat
):

Linear regression model is used for the prediction.
But it does not show any meaningful performance in predicting the type of arrhythmia.
Looking to use other models / neural nets for better performance in the next attempt.
